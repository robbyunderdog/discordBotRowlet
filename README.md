## FAQ

#### Will (insert moderation feature here) ever come to Rowlet?

Most probably, it is a slow process but we are slowly adding everything someone might need for their server.

#### Can I alter rules or permissions of Rowlet?

Right now no. In the future adding customization to what or how the bot works is definitely something I want to work on.
