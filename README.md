# Rowlet
Rowlet is a test Discord bot for experimenting with discord.js.

Learning Javascript is rough, but it seems to be a much faster option than python for certain tasks, mainly Octave, my music playing bot. Octave has issues with downloading songs while playing them at the same time, so hopefully JavaScripts speed will be able to help mitigate that issue.
